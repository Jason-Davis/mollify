#summary Instructions for editing file descriptions

= Introduction =
Mollify supports file descriptions in the backend file system. Each file can have a custom description that is shown in the file context popup panel.


= Details =

File descriptions are defined in a file named "descript.ion". This file is hidden from the frontend listings, but is read by the backend.

Rules are:
  * Each folder has its own "descript.ion"
  * Plain text document
  * Line format is "<FILENAME> <DESCRIPTION>", where file name and description separated by a white space
  * If the file name itself contains spaces, surround the name with quote marks
  * One file description per a document line

Example (ignore the syntax coloring):

----
{{{
Document.pdf Description for a Portable Document Format file.
"Example Datasheet.xls" Description for the Microsoft Excel document.
}}}
----

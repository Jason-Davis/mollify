Mollify supports PHP extension called APC (Alternative PHP Cache) to get file uploading status information. This document explains how to enable this feature.


= Details =

Mollify supports PHP extension called APC ([http://fi.php.net/manual/en/intro.apc.php Alternative PHP Cache]), which is a free cache implementation to PHP versions >= 4.3.

By default this is disabled in Mollify. It can be enabled in configuration (configuration.php) with following steps:

1) Make sure APC is installed in php server (for more information, see troubleshooting below)

2) Make sure APC extension is enabled in php.ini

In section "Dynamic Extensions", add line `extension=apc.so` (in linux or Mac) or `extension=apc.dll` (in Windows)

3) Make sure 

4) Enable Mollify feature

Open configuration settings (configuration.php) and change following setting:
`$ENABLE_UPLOAD_PROGRESS = TRUE;`

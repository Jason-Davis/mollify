#summary How to enable file upload progress display
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Mollify supports PHP extension called APC (Alternative PHP Cache), which implements a file upload hook to php. APC is available at PECL ([http://pecl.php.net/ PHP Extension Community Library]) or PEAR ([http://pear.php.net/ PHP Extension and Application Repository]).


= Requirements =

APC requires PHP versions >= 5.2 and PEAR >= 1.4.

= Installation =

== 1. Installing APC ==

  # To install it in Windows, download PECL and the APC extension from [http://pecl4win.php.net/]

  # To install it in Debian linux (Ubuntu etc), use following commands:

`apt-get install apache2
apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
apt-get install php-pear
apt-get install php5-dev
apt-get install make
apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev
pecl install apc`

  # In Mac installations (MAMP), APC is already included as long as PHP 5 is selected.

== 2. Configuring APC ==

1) Make sure APC extension is enabled in php.ini

In section "Dynamic Extensions", add line

`extension=apc.so` (in linux or Mac)

or

`extension=apc.dll` (in Windows)

2) Make sure file upload hook is enabled in php.ini

Anywhere in the php.ini, following setting is needed:

`apc.rfc1867 = on`


== 3. Configuring Mollify ==

Open configuration settings (configuration.php) and change following setting:

`$ENABLE_UPLOAD_PROGRESS = TRUE;`

That's it.


== Troubleshooting ==

=== PHP error for missing function "apc_fetch" ===

If you get complains about missing function "apc_fetch", APC is not installed. APC is provided via PECL (PHP Extension Community Library), more information can be found here: [http://fi.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php]

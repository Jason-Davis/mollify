Mollify supports PHP extension called APC (Alternative PHP Cache) to get file uploading status information. This document explains how to enable this feature.



= Details =


Mollify supports PHP extension called APC ([http://fi.php.net/manual/en/intro.apc.php Alternative PHP Cache]), which is a free cache implementation to PHP versions >= 5.2.

By default this is disabled in Mollify. It can be enabled in configuration (configuration.php) with following steps:

1) Make sure APC is installed in php server (for more information, see troubleshooting below)

2) Make sure APC extension is enabled in php.ini

In section "Dynamic Extensions", add line `extension=apc.so` (in linux or Mac) or `extension=apc.dll` (in Windows)

3) Make sure file upload hook is enabled in php.ini

Anywhere in the php.ini, following setting is needed:

`apc.rfc1867 = on`

4) Enable Mollify feature

Open configuration settings (configuration.php) and change following setting:
`$ENABLE_UPLOAD_PROGRESS = TRUE;`



= Troubleshooting =

== PHP error for missing function "apc_fetch" ==

If you get complains about missing function "apc_fetch", APC is not installed. APC is provided via PECL (PHP Extension Community Library), more information can be found here: [http://fi.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php]

1) To install it in Windows, download PECL and the APC extension from [http://pecl4win.php.net/]

2) To install it in Debian linux (Ubuntu etc), use following commands:

`apt-get install apache2
apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
apt-get install php-pear
apt-get install php5-dev
apt-get install make
apt-get install apache2-prefork-dev
pecl install apc`

3) In Mac installations (MAMP), APC is already included as long as PHP 5 is selected.
